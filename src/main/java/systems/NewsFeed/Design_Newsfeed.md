# Design Newsfeed

# 0000-system-design-news-feeds
- include status update, photos, videos, links, activity and likes
- from people, pages, groups you followed
- Facebook news feeds, Instagram feed, Twitter timeline etc
- push, email, 400K, 5M
- local platform, job, deals

## Functional Requirements
- a user may has many friends or follow a large number of pages and groups
- newsfeed will be generated based on posts from people, pages, groups that a user follows
- feeds may contain text, image and videos
- user can refresh and view newsfeeds
- newfeeds are sorted by reverse chrononlogical order
- a user can receive notification when there's news feeds update
- both mobile app and web pages

## Non-funtional Requirements
- it's better to generate newsfeed in real-time
- maxmium latency seen by end user would be 2 seconds
- a post should not take more than 5 second before assumed

## Capacity Estimation
- 300M daily active user, see newsfeed 5 times per day
- QPS: 1.5B / 24 / 3600 ~= 1.5 * 10^9 / 10^5 = 15K read
- Memory: 300M * 500 * 1K = 150TB = 100G * 1500 machines

## System API
- int post(token, content)
- List<Long> getNewsfeed(token, count, beforePostId, afterPostId)

## Database Design
- users(id, lastName, firstName, email, birth, createAt, lastLogin)
- access_tokens(id, token, userId)
- entities(id, name, type, desc)
- follows(id, friendOrEntityId, type)
- posts(id, entityType, entityId, lat, lon, content, likes)
- medias(id, type, link)
- post_medias(id, postId, mediaId)
- TODO-PG 表继承

## High Level Design
- Publish Feed / Fanout
    - write to cache and DB, populated to friends's new feed
    - by analogy 类推
    - Push / fanout on write, the right pull cadence 节奏
    - Pull / fanout on load,
- Build News Feed
    - Pull
        - retrieve IDs of all users/groups/pages a user follows
        - retrieve the latest, most popular and relavant posts
        - rank these posts with based on the relavance, likes, commets, shares, update time
        - sort the feed in the cache and return top 20
        - return next 20 if scroll down
        - periodically rank for the new posts and notify
        - high backlogs 高积压
    - Offline
        - dedicated server to generate continuously
        - not compiled on load 符合负载，regular basis 定期
        - LRU, LinkedHashMap
        - keep 20 posts * 10 page in memory
        - only generate for active user or with login pattern

```

- WebServer: maintain user connection, auth and limit rate
- PostService: Persist Post data into DB and cache
- Newsfeed Service: store posts/feeds
- NewsFeed Cache: store news feed IDs
- Retrieve Newsfeed
    - request newsfeed, like /rest/feed?before=1234&count=20
    - LB distribute traffic to WebServer
    - WebServer call Newsfeed Service
    - Newsfeed Service gets post ID list from Newsfeed Cache
    - Newsfeed Service gets user info, post content from user/post cache/DB
    - The full hydrated newsfeed is returned in JSON format.

## Detail Design

- Fanout Service
- write, push, pre-compute, real time, fast, Cons: too many friend, hotkey/celebrity problem, inactive user
- read, pull, on demand, suitable for inactive user and celebrity, Cons: slow
- Hybrid, push for majority
- FanoutWorker read <PostID, FriendID>

## Partition
- Sharding UserDB, PostDB
- Sharding Newsfeed Cache by userID, Consistent Hash

## Cache Architecture
- NewsFeed:
- Content: HostCache, Normal
- Social: Follower, Following
- Action: Like, Reply, Others
- Counter: Like, Reply

## Terminology
- reverse chronological
- build behind the scence
- avoid pitfall
- crucial
- overload
- slim
- the full hydrated news feed
- compilation
- scrollable
